# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 03, 2017 2351hrs

I currently learning Python so thought building a web app with Django would be a nice chanllenge.

Today I installed Django on my pc and worked through a couple of tutorials from Youtube. Today has been a
bit of a struggle grasping the way a website is built in Django using Python. 

I learned allot today.

Time for bed!
