# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 03, 2017 2351hrs

I currently learning Python so thought building a web app with Django would be a nice chanllenge.

Today I installed Django on my pc and worked through a couple of tutorials from Youtube. Today has been a
bit of a struggle grasping the way a website is built in Django using Python. 

I learned allot today.

Time for bed!

#####################################
DAY 2
#####################################

A little further with the Django project today. Brushed up on git skills.
My work enviroment needs to be adjusted.
Logging my progress is good. This hour was well spent!

Until tomorrow OR unless I can't sleep and have to code...

########################################
Day 3
########################################

I know I am putting this in late. So I will be adding an extra day at the end of the 
challenge.

I finally understand Django url patterns. It feels good to finally know how it works
without blindly following a recipe.

######################################
Day 3.1
######################################
Over 90 minutes today!

I needed to learn more basic Python before continuing with my web app
projects. Started building a Telegram chat bot using Python. 

I can't wait till its finished. Named it after my oldest son, Saul.

This challenge has been keeping me motivated. Now I need to be more
motivated to do the push up challenge!

Until tommorow...

Keeping on track now. It feels like its becoming a habit now. I have been working with
